# tests if graph can correctly identify a path from the node to itself
created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to B in simpleGraph

simpleGraph contains: A B C D

the children of A in simpleGraph are: B(10.000) C(1.000)

path from A to A:
