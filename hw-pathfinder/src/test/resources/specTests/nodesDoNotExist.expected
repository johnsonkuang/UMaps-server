# tests whether graph identifies nodes not in the graph
created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 10.000 from B to A in graph
added edge 1.000 from B to B in graph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in graph
added edge 1.000 from C to B in graph
added edge 20.000 from A to C in graph
added edge 20.000 from C to A in graph
added edge 5.000 from D to A in graph
added edge 7.000 from D to A in graph

graph contains: A B C D
the children of A in graph are: B(10.000) C(20.000) D(5.000) D(7.000)
the children of B in graph are: A(10.000) B(1.000) C(1.000)
the children of C in graph are: A(20.000) B(1.000) D(3.000)
the children of D in graph are: A(5.000) A(7.000) C(3.000)
