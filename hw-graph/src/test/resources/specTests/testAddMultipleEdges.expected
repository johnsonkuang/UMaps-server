# Test Add Multiple Edges
# tests the creation of multiple edge creations

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add four nodes to the graph
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add a edge connecting n1 and n2
added edge A from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Add a edge connecting n2 and n3
added edge B from n2 to n3 in graph1

# Add a edge connecting n2 and n4
added edge C from n3 to n4 in graph1

# Add a edge connecting n4 and n1
added edge D from n4 to n1 in graph1
