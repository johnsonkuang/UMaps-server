# Test ListChildren method
# Test whether a graph can list the children of a parent node

# Create graph
created graph graph1

# Add parent and children nodes
added node parent to graph1
added node A to graph1
added node B to graph1
added node C to graph1
added node D to graph1
added node E to graph1

# Add edges between parent and all other nodes
added edge e1 from parent to A in graph1
added edge e2 from parent to B in graph1
added edge e3 from parent to C in graph1
added edge e4 from parent to D in graph1
added edge e5 from parent to E in graph1

# List children of parent
the children of parent in graph1 are: A(e1) B(e2) C(e3) D(e4) E(e5)
