# Tests a node linked to itself
# Tests whether a node can be linked to itself via an edge

# Create graph
created graph graph1

# Add node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add edge connecting itself
added edge circularEdge from n1 to n1 in graph1

# List the nodes in graph1
graph1 contains: n1

# List the children of n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(circularEdge)
